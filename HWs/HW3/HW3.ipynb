    "## Our question, strategy, and some terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the effect of having children on women's labor force participation?  That is, if a woman has many children, does that make her less likely to be employed?  Or the opposite?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a question where an RCT seems impossible or unethical.  However, we can still look for **natural experiments.**  A natural experiment is when something happens that we think is *pretty* random, and that generates variation in the variable we care about (in this case number of children).  The thing that we think is \"pretty random\" is called an **instrumental variable.** We'll talk more about instrumental variables in Class 4, but you can get started on this assignment after Class 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our assignment today uses data from both the US and Turkey, and follows an idea from a 1998 paper by Angrist and Evans (citation below).  The basic idea is this: it turns out that if a woman has two children of the *same* sex, she is more likely to have a third child.  Since whether or a woman's first two children are the same sex as each other seems pretty random (uncorrelated with anything relevant about the woman), we can use this as an **instrument** for number of children.  That is, if a woman randomly has two boys or two girls, rather than a boy and a girl, as her first two children, we think that she's (randomly) more likely to have a third child.  We can use this random variation and *pretend* we have an RCT, even when we don't!  Then we'll use our analysis of RCTs (and in particular how to compute the Local Average Treatment Effect, or LATE) on this natural experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the jargon above, our **instrumental variable** is whether or not a women has two same-sex or two different-sex children as her first two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">**NOTE:** We'll talk more about instrumental variables and natural experiments (and this particular paper by Angrist and Evans) in Class 4.
